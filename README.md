# üîç Project Overview

Analyze NVIDIA‚Äôs historical stock performance (1999‚Äì2025).

Compare NVIDIA‚Äôs yearly returns with the NASDAQ Composite.

Apply technical indicators such as the Golden Cross and Death Cross to assess short-term momentum.

Build visual dashboards using Tableau & Flourish.

# üóÇ Steps Followed

1. Data Collection

   - Extracted historical daily price data (OHLC ‚Äì Open, High, Low, Close) for NVIDIA and NASDAQ.

   - Timeframe: Jan 22, 1999 ‚Äì Aug 8, 2025.

    - Used cleaned datasets for annual and technical analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing

   - Converted raw trading data into yearly returns (%).

   - Computed moving averages (MA20, MA50) for technical indicator analysis.

   - Standardized data format for Tableau and Flourish.

3. Visualization

   - Line Charts: NVIDIA OHLC trend.

   - Yearly Returns Comparison: NVIDIA vs. NASDAQ.

   - Technical Indicators: Golden Cross & Death Cross analysis over the last 300 trading days.

   Tools used:

     - Tableau

     - Flourish

4. Analysis

  - NVIDIA‚Äôs Growth Journey: From early 2000s volatility to exponential rise fueled by AI, gaming, and data center growth.

  - Yearly Returns: NVIDIA consistently outperformed NASDAQ, though with sharper volatility.

  - Technical Signals:

     - Golden Crosses aligned with strong bullish runs.

     - Death Crosses marked temporary corrections but were usually followed by rebounds.

       Both are lagging indicators and should not be used in isolation.
